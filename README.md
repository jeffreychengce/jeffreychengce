## About Me

Civil and environmental engineering Ph.D. candidate at UC Berkeley in the Structural Engineering, Mechanics and Materials program. Advised by Professor Matthew DeJong.

## Research Projects
Differentiable physics for structural health monitoring. 
- Developed dynamic and Differentiable Material Point Model (DiffMPM) simulator in JAX and Taichi.
- Developed static and Differentiable Finite Element Model (DiffFEM) simulator in Warp.

Data-Driven Train Classification from Dynamic Strain Monitoring Data
- Developed Python ML framework to classify trains from dynamic strain data collected from an array of 60 FOS installed on a 150-year-old masonry bridge with 96% accuracy.
- Performed signal processing, data cleaning, EDA, and feature extraction of 4870 strain recordings via Python.
